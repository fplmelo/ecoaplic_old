  My research is guided by the following question: How to manage and restore social-ecological landscapes? To answer this question, I draw on both the theoretical and analytical tools of natural sciences and on the social-ecological systems (SES) framework. I am interested in all kinds of interactions between biodiversity and human activities that take place in working landscapes such as rangelands, farmlands, peri-urban and fragmented landscapes. My research goals are shared between basic and applied sciences with a strong interdisciplinary integration. My contributions to basic sciences cover: functional ecology, forest regrowth, plant species assembly, plant-animal interactions, biological invasion, and landscape ecology. In terms of applied sciences I’ve been producing pieces of work on: use of natural resources, ecological restoration, political ecology and conservation sciences.
